switch-case implementation in python3

Wondering how we used a program to enter a number and print the corresponding day of the week using the switch-case statements in c++ or java? Want to do the same in python? Well, maybe you are known to the fact that python doesn't have a switch-case implementation. Then? Can't we create such a program in python without using so many ifs and elifs? Well, the answer is we can.
    In python, we don't have a switch-case statement but we can use dictionary implementation for this purpose.
Consider the following code snippet for a simple calculator program in python3.

num1 = int(input("Enter First number : "))
num2 = int(input("Enter Second number : "))

print("Choose operation")
print("1. Add")
print("2. Subtract")
print("3. Multiply")
print("4. Divide")
print("5. Remainder")

ch = int(input("Enter your choice : "))
if(ch==1):
    print("Sum is %s" %(num1+num2))
elif(ch==2):
    print("Difference is %s" %(num1 - num2))
elif(ch==3):
    print("Product is %s" %(num1 * num2))
elif(ch==4):
    print("Quotient is %s" %(num1/num2))
elif(ch==5):
    print("Remainder is %s" %(num1 % num2))


    
Want to implement the same without using so many comparisons?
Here's an alternative for that in python3.

num1, num2 = input("Enter two numbers separated by comma : ").split(",")
num1=int(num1)
num2=int(num2)
print("Entered numbers are \n%s \n%s"%(num1,num2))
ch = int(input("Choose operation\n1. Add\n2. Subtract\n3. Multiply\n4. Divide\n5. Remainder\n"))

def switch(ch):
    case = {
        1: "Sum is %s" %(num1+num2),
        2: "Difference %s" %(num1-num2),
        3: "Product is %s" %(num1*num2),
        4: "Quotient is %s" %(num1/num2),
        5: "Remainder is %s" %(num1%num2)
    }
    return print(case.get(ch, "Invalid Selection"))
switch(ch)


Here we have used a dictionary(case) to store the respective cases. The function switch() takes an argument(that actually is the choice made by the user). When case.get() is called, get returns the choice made by the user and the dictionary(case) takes this value as the key and returns the value corresponding to this key which is then printed on the screen.

Hope this helps you understand the simple implementation of the switch-case statement in python(3).
